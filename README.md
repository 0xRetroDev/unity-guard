## Advanced Security Scanner for Unity Games & .NET Assemblies

Unity Guard is a powerful security scanner for Unity games and .NET assemblies that uses machine learning to identify security vulnerabilities with increasing accuracy over time. The tool automatically analyzes code, generates detailed security reports, and provides actionable recommendations to help developers secure their applications.

## Key Features

- **ML-Powered Security Analysis**: Leverages machine learning models that improve over time as they process more games and assemblies
- **ONNX Export Support**: Export trained models for use in other applications and environments
- **Comprehensive Vulnerability Detection**:
  - API key and credential exposure
  - Insecure serialization
  - Unsafe code usage
  - Insecure network calls
  - Path traversal vulnerabilities
  - Cryptographic weaknesses
  - And many more...
- **Detailed HTML Reports**: Beautiful, comprehensive reports with severity ratings, CVSS scores, and actionable recommendations
- **Intuitive Console Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line interface with real-time analysis feedback
- **Continuous Learning**: The more games you scan, the smarter it gets at detecting security issues

## üß† Machine Learning Integration

Unity Guard uses machine learning to continuously improve its detection capabilities. The more you use it, the better it gets at finding security vulnerabilities.

### ML Features (Heavily Experimental) (WIP)

- **Automatic Training**: The model learns from each scan to improve future detection
- **False Positive Reduction**: Smart identification of potential false positives
- **ONNX Export**: Export your trained model for use in other applications or environments
- **Training Metrics**: View detailed metrics about your model's learning progress


## üîç Security Issues Detected

Unity Guard can detect a wide range of security vulnerabilities, including:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Credential Exposure** | API keys, passwords, connection strings |
| **Unsafe Code** | Unsafe code blocks, memory operations, P/Invoke |
| **Insecure Networking** | HTTP instead of HTTPS, certificate validation disabled |
| **Serialization** | BinaryFormatter usage, unsafe JSON deserialization |
| **Cryptography** | Weak hashing (MD5/SHA1), insecure random numbers |
| **File Operations** | Path traversal, unsafe file access |
| **Input Validation** | SQL injection, command injection risks |
| **Unity-Specific** | Insecure PlayerPrefs, unsafe SendMessage usage |

## üìä Report Structure

Each generated report includes:

- **Executive Summary**: Overall risk assessment
- **Severity Breakdown**: Issues categorized by severity
- **Detailed Issue Reports**: For each vulnerability:
  - Issue type and location
  - Severity and CVSS score
  - Detailed description
  - Code context and line number
  - Specific recommendations for remediation

## üîÑ ML Model Training Details

The ML system in Unity Guard uses a multi-layered approach:

1. **Feature Extraction**: Analyzes code for security patterns
2. **Classification**: Determines severity and risk level
3. **False Positive Reduction**: Uses contextual analysis to reduce false positives
4. **Continuous Learning**: Updates model weights based on scan results

## üß™ Advanced Usage

### Command Line Arguments

Unity Guard supports the following command line arguments:

```
UnityGuard.exe [watchFolder] [outputFolder]
```

- `watchFolder`: Custom directory to watch for games/DLLs (default: ScannerInput)
