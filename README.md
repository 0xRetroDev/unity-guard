## üîí Advanced Security Scanner for Unity Games & .NET Assemblies

UnityGuard is a powerful security scanner for Unity games and .NET assemblies that uses machine learning to identify security vulnerabilities with increasing accuracy over time. The tool automatically analyzes code, generates detailed security reports, and provides actionable recommendations to help developers secure their applications.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **ML-Powered Security Analysis**: Leverages machine learning models that improve over time as they process more games and assemblies
- **ONNX Export Support**: Export trained models for use in other applications and environments
- **Comprehensive Vulnerability Detection**:
  - API key and credential exposure
  - Insecure serialization
  - Unsafe code usage
  - Insecure network calls
  - Path traversal vulnerabilities
  - Cryptographic weaknesses
  - And many more...
- **Detailed HTML Reports**: Beautiful, comprehensive reports with severity ratings, CVSS scores, and actionable recommendations
- **Intuitive Console Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line interface with real-time analysis feedback
- **Continuous Learning**: The more games you scan, the smarter it gets at detecting security issues

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows, macOS, or Linux
- .NET 6.0 or higher
- At least 4GB of available RAM
- 2GB of available storage

### Installation

#### Option 1: Download the Latest Release

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/SynaptechDynamics/UnityGuard/releases) for your platform
2. Extract the archive to your preferred location
3. Run `UnityGuard.exe` (Windows) or `UnityGuard` (macOS/Linux)

#### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SynaptechDynamics/UnityGuard.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd UnityGuard

# Build the project
dotnet build -c Release

# Run the application
dotnet run --project UnitySecurityScanner/UnitySecurityScanner.csproj
```

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Scanning a Unity Game

1. Launch UnityGuard
2. Drop your Unity game folder into the watch folder (shown in the console interface)
3. Press `S` to start scanning
4. View the results in the generated HTML report in the Reports folder

### Scanning Individual DLLs

1. Launch UnityGuard
2. Drop your DLL files into the watch folder
3. Press `S` to start scanning
4. View the results in the generated HTML report

### Available Commands

- `S` - Start scanning all pending items
- `L` - List current pending items
- `C` - Clear screen and show instructions
- `Q` - Quit the application

## üß† Machine Learning Integration

UnityGuard uses machine learning to continuously improve its detection capabilities. The more you use it, the better it gets at finding security vulnerabilities.

![ML Architecture](assets/ml-architecture.png)

### ML Features

- **Automatic Training**: The model learns from each scan to improve future detection
- **False Positive Reduction**: Smart identification of potential false positives
- **ONNX Export**: Export your trained model for use in other applications or environments
- **Training Metrics**: View detailed metrics about your model's learning progress

### Using ONNX Exports

The ONNX export feature allows you to use your trained Mizuki model in other environments:

```csharp
// Example code for using exported ONNX model
using Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime;

// Load the exported model
using var session = new InferenceSession("path/to/mizuki_model.onnx");

// Prepare input data
var inputTensor = new DenseTensor<float>(new[] { 1, 20 });
// Fill in your input data here...

// Run inference
var inputs = new List<NamedOnnxValue> { NamedOnnxValue.CreateFromTensor("input", inputTensor) };
using var results = session.Run(inputs);

// Process results
var outputTensor = results.First().AsTensor<float>();
float prediction = outputTensor[0];
```

## üîç Security Issues Detected

UnityGuard can detect a wide range of security vulnerabilities, including:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Credential Exposure** | API keys, passwords, connection strings |
| **Unsafe Code** | Unsafe code blocks, memory operations, P/Invoke |
| **Insecure Networking** | HTTP instead of HTTPS, certificate validation disabled |
| **Serialization** | BinaryFormatter usage, unsafe JSON deserialization |
| **Cryptography** | Weak hashing (MD5/SHA1), insecure random numbers |
| **File Operations** | Path traversal, unsafe file access |
| **Input Validation** | SQL injection, command injection risks |
| **Unity-Specific** | Insecure PlayerPrefs, unsafe SendMessage usage |

## üìä Report Structure

Each generated report includes:

- **Executive Summary**: Overall risk assessment
- **Severity Breakdown**: Issues categorized by severity
- **Detailed Issue Reports**: For each vulnerability:
  - Issue type and location
  - Severity and CVSS score
  - Detailed description
  - Code context and line number
  - Specific recommendations for remediation

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

UnityGuard can be configured via the `ScannerConfig.json` file in the application directory:

```json
{
  "ScanForUnsafeSerialization": true,
  "ScanForUnsafeCode": true,
  "ScanForInsecureFileOps": true,
  "ScanForInsecureNetworking": true,
  "ScanForHardcodedSecrets": true,
  "EnableDeepScan": false,
  "MaxConcurrentScans": 4,
  "IgnoredVulnerabilities": [
    "Inefficient GameObject.Find"
  ]
}
```

## üîÑ ML Model Training Details

The ML system in UnityGuard uses a multi-layered approach:

1. **Feature Extraction**: Analyzes code for security patterns
2. **Classification**: Determines severity and risk level
3. **False Positive Reduction**: Uses contextual analysis to reduce false positives
4. **Continuous Learning**: Updates model weights based on scan results

## üß™ Advanced Usage

### Command Line Arguments

UnityGuard supports the following command line arguments:

```
UnityGuard.exe [watchFolder] [outputFolder]
```

- `watchFolder`: Custom directory to watch for games/DLLs (default: ScannerInput)
- `outputFolder`: Custom directory for reports (default: Reports)

### Programmatic Integration

You can integrate UnityGuard into your CI/CD pipeline:

```csharp
using UnitySecurityScanner;

// Initialize scanner
var mlAnalyzer = new MLSecurityAnalyzer("path/to/model.zip");
var scanner = new SecurityScanner("path/to/assembly.dll");

// Scan for vulnerabilities
var issues = scanner.ScanForVulnerabilities();

// Enhance with ML
issues = issues.EnhanceWithML(mlAnalyzer);

// Process results
foreach (var issue in issues)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{issue.Severity}: {issue.IssueType} in {issue.Location}");
}
```
